## Implementation of an IP address Geolocator


In this repository you can find a file named ```ip_address.py``` that implements the ```get_location(ip_address)``` function.
Such function queries the [ip-api](https://ip-api.com/docs/api:json) website to fetch data about the location of the given input ```ip_address```.
If you run the program, executing the main file with: ```python main.py``` it will give you an output similar to the following: 

```
$ python main.py
IP address 153.138.24.18 is from Chiyoda, Japan 
```

The project requires ```json``` and ```requests``` modules to run. The API offers several information beyond country and city (like region, zip, latutude and longitude and so on): you can explore different options to be implemented in your projects. Note that also a "status" flag is returned to indicate the success of the request (the endpoint is limited to 45 requests per minute from an IP address).
